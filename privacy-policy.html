          <p><strong>The legal basis for and purpose of the processing of personal data</strong></p>
          <p>The basis for processing personal data is the legitimate interest of the company based on customer relationship or other connection.</p>
          <p><strong>What data do we process?</strong></p>
          <p>Your name, email address and content of your message is collected when you submit your information using the contact form.</p>
          <p>Your data is not used for any other purposes or shared with third parties.</p>
          <p>We process the following personal data of the customer or other data subject in connection with the customer register:</p>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>information of the customer and data subject such as name, email address and phone number</li>
            <li>information regarding the company and its contact persons, such as business ID, names, profession or position in the company, field of expertise and contact information of the contact persons</li>
            <li>information regarding the customership and contract, such as information of past and existing contracts and orders, other transaction information such as correspondence with the customer/data subject, cookies and information associated with them, payment and account information, as well as information voluntarily provided by the customer himself to the company system</li>
            <li>other possible information collected based on the consent of the data subject</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>How do we protect the data and how long do we store them?</strong></p>
          <p>Only those of our employees, who on behalf of their work are entitled to process customer data, are entitled to use a system containing personal data. Each user has a personal username and password to the system. The information is collected into databases that are protected by firewalls, passwords and other technical measures. The databases and the backup copies of them are in locked premises and can be accessed only by certain pre-designated persons.</p>
          <p>We store the personal data for as long as is necessary considering the purpose of the processing.</p>
          <p>We regularly assess the need for data retention in light of the applicable legislation. In addition, we take reasonable measures to ensure that the personal data in the register is not incompatible, obsolete or inaccurate considering the purpose of the processing. We rectify or delete such information without delay.</p>
          <p><strong>What are your rights as a data subject?</strong></p>
          <p>As a data subject you have a right to inspect the personal data concerning yourself, which is stored in the register, and a right to require rectification or erasure of the data, provided that the request has a legal basis. You also have a right to withdraw or change your consent.</p>
          <p>As a data subject, you have a right, according to EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (applied from 25.5.2018) to object processing or request restricting the processing and lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for processing personal data.</p>
          <p>For specific personal reasons, you also have the right to object to profiling and other processing operations, when the processing of your data is based on our customer relationship with you. In connection with your request, you will need to identify the specific situation, based on which you object to the processing. We can refuse the request of objection only on legal grounds.</p>
          <p>As a data subject you have the right to object to processing at any time free of charge, including profiling in so far as it relates to direct marketing.</p>
          <p>You can request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. Please send your request to info@consensus-capital.com.</p>
